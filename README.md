### JSONX

A copy of the json package shipped with Go 1.6.2 with the addition of ```MarshalOptions```.  See ```MarshalWithOptions``` function in encode file.

This is almost certainly a very poor way to extend the json package but it works for me for now until I work out the idiomatic way to achieve the same result in Go.
